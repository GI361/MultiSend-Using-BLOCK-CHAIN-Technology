# MultiSend-Using-BLOCK-CHAIN-Technology
# Multi-Send Smart Contract

## Description

The **MultiSend** smart contract is designed to allow users to send Ether to multiple Ethereum addresses in a single transaction. This contract is particularly useful for:

- ‚úÖ Bulk payments  
- ‚úÖ Salary distribution  
- ‚úÖ Token airdrops  

It divides the total Ether sent equally among all recipient addresses and refunds any remaining balance (if the total value is not perfectly divisible) back to the sender.

---

## Features

- Allows sending Ether to multiple recipients in one go.
- Ensures equal distribution of Ether.
- Automatically refunds any leftover wei to the sender.
- Sets the deploying user as the contract owner.
